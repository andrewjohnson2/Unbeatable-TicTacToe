Algorithm found here used to implement "hard" option. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

UPDATE:
This is beatable. There is a series of moves that can beat the computer on the "Unbeatable" Difficulty"

UPDATE 2:
This was my first attempt at Javascript. After gaining more experience with JS I have learned that many
of the coding practices in this project are not good.
